## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Ensure that Node.js, preferably version 16 or higher, is installed on your system, as this project utilizes the latest versions of TypeScript and Nodemon.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): npm is the package manager for Node.js and comes with the Node.js installation.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/singnet/ai-web-ui-constructor-backend
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd ai-web-ui-constructor-backend
```

Install the project dependencies:

```
npm i
```

## Usage

For development purposes, you can run the application using Nodemon to automatically restart the server when changes are detected. Execute the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the server at `http://localhost:3000` by default. You can change the port in the `src/index.ts` file or create an `.env` file to manage the environt-specific variables separately.

For production, you can build the TypeScript files and then start the server. Run the following commands:

```
npm run build
npm start
```
